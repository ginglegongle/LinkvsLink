Link is the only playable character in BOTW and TOTK, two incredibly crafted video games made by nintendo

In both games you, the player, experieinces Link's adventure from a first hand perspective, being open world games, they allow for less limited exploration of the areas in the game, as compared to most other games that are more heavily formatted. You can open doors and enter random unrestricted places, jump through fields, tame horses, fight the final boss after just entering the game! ( a great feauture for speed runners)

<p>
Aside from it's open world play style, it is also gorgeous. From the landscapes, to the buildings, lights and shadows, every blade of grass is rendered beautifully, I personally believe that you could enjoy the game by just speaking to villiagers and travelling around, alone! Though the actual storyline and game-play are unmatched in my opinion.
