<h1> Link is the only playable character in BOTW and TOTK, two incredibly crafted video games made by nintendo. </h1>

<h2> Shared Traits </h2> In both games you, the player, experiences Link's adventure from a first hand perspective, being open world games, they allow for less limited exploration of the areas in the game, as compared to most other games that are more heavily formatted. You can open doors and enter random unrestricted places, jump through fields, tame horses, fight the final boss after just entering the game! ( a great feauture for speed runners)

<h2> 
Visuals
</h2>
Aside from their open world play style, they're also gorgeous. From the landscapes, to the buildings, lights and shadows, every blade of grass is rendered beautifully, I personally believe that you could enjoy the games by just speaking to the villiagers and travelling around, alone! Though the actual storyline and game-play are unmatched as well, in my opinion.

<h2>Differences</h2>
Botw is the overall base and fundamental version of Hyrule, whilst Totk is the improved and shinier version, they both have individualities that make them distinct parts of the story and vibe of their respective times
